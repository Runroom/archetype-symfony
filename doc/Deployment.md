# Deployment

Archetype deployments use the [Deployer](https://deployer.org) tool. It can be configured using the
deploy.php file in the project's root folder.

If you started an Archetype project using the init_project.sh script you shouldn't need to edit the
deployer config file at all. Otherwise, you'll need to edit the repository parameter.

For more options see the [Deployer documentation](https://deployer.org/docs).
