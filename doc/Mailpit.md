# Mailpit

Mailpit is a SMTP server used in local development to catch all emails sent from your app. It works
by setting the `MAILER_DSN` to: `smtp://mailer:1025` on your `.env` file.

You can access to the Mailpit Inbox here: `https://localhost:8425`

Using the Inbox you can view all the emails sent by the App.
